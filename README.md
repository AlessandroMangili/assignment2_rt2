# Assignment 2

## Overview

This project is split into two part: [partI](https://github.com/AlessandroMangili/assignment2_rt2/tree/partI) and [partII](https://github.com/AlessandroMangili/assignment2_rt2/tree/partII). The goal was to replace the original user interface of the [second assignment](https://github.com/AlessandroMangili/assignment2_rt) with a more user-friendly and interactive **Jupyter Notebook** that allows for:

1. Setting or canceling robot navigation goals (target positions).
2. Displaying real-time robot position and distance from the closest obstacle.
3. Visualizing the robot's path using live animation.
4. Plotting statistics of reached vs. not-reached goals.
